**Platform**: *Android/iOS/Mac/Windows/Linux*

**Build**: *The build number under the title in the main menu. Required. "LATEST" IS NOT A VERSION, I NEED THE EXACT BUILD NUMBER OF YOUR GAME.*

**Issue**: *Explain your issue in detail.*

**Steps to reproduce**: *How you happened across the issue, and what exactly you did to make the bug happen.*

**Link(s) to mod(s) used**: *The mod repositories or zip files that are related to the issue, if applicable.*

**Save file**: *The (zipped) save file you were playing on when the bug happened. THIS IS REQUIRED FOR ANY ISSUE HAPPENING IN-GAME OR IN MULTIPLAYER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU THINK IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE. DO NOT DELETE OR OMIT THIS LINE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE THAT THE ISSUE DOES NOT HAPPEN IN-GAME. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SAVE, DON'T WASTE TIME OPENING THIS ISSUE.*

If you remove the line above without reading it properly and understanding what it means, I will reap your soul. Even if you're playing on someone's server, you can still save the game to a slot.

**(Crash) logs**: *Either crash reports from the crash folder, or the file you get when you go into Settings -> Game Data -> Export Crash logs. REQUIRED if you are reporting a crash.*
