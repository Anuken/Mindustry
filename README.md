## Building

Bleeding-edge builds are generated automatically for every commit. You can see them [here](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases).

If you'd rather compile on your own, follow these instructions.
First, make sure you have [JDK 16](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot) installed. **Other JDK versions will not work.** Open a terminal in the Mindustry directory and run the following commands:

### Windows

_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  
_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`  
_Sprite Packing:_ `gradlew tools:pack`

### Linux/Mac OS

_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  
_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`  
_Sprite Packing:_ `./gradlew tools:pack`

### Server

Server builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.

### Android

1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) Make sure you're downloading the "Command line tools only", as Android Studio is not required.
2. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory.
3. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.

To debug the application on a connected phone, run `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`.

### Troubleshooting

#### Permission Denied

If the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*

---

Gradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>
After building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.
