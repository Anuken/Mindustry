## Building

To compile on your own, follow these instructions.
First, make sure you have [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot) installed. **Other JDK versions will not work.** Open a terminal in the Mindustry directory and run the following commands:

### Windows

_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  
_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`  
_Sprite Packing:_ `gradlew tools:pack`

### Linux/Mac OS

_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  
_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`  
_Sprite Packing:_ `./gradlew tools:pack`

### Server

To compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.

### Android

1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) Make sure you're downloading the "Command line tools only", as Android Studio is not required.
2. In the unzipped Android SDK folder, find the cmdline-tools directory. Then create a folder inside of it called `latest` and put all of its contents into the newly created folder.
3. In the same directory run the command `sdkmanager --licenses` (or `./sdkmanager --licenses` if on linux/mac)
4. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory.
5. Enable developer mode on your device/emulator. If you are on testing on a phone you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling), otherwise you need to google how to enable your emulator's developer mode specifically.
6. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.

To debug the application on a connected device/emulator, run `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`.

### Troubleshooting

#### Permission Denied

If the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*

#### Where is the `mindustry.gen` package?

As the name implies, `mindustry.gen` is generated *at build time* based on other code. You will not find source code for this package in the repository, and it should not be edited by hand.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of the "source" of generated code in `mindustry.gen`:

- `Call`, `*Packet` classes: Generated from methods marked with `@Remote`.
- All entity classes (`Unit`, `EffectState`, `Posc`, etc): Generated from component classes in the `mindustry.entities.comp` package, and combined using definitions in `mindustry.content.UnitTypes`.
- `Sounds`, `Musics`, `Tex`, `Icon`, etc: Generated based on files in the respective asset folders.

Gradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>
After building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.
