sector.groundZero.description = The optimal location to begin once more. Low enemy threat. Few resources.\nGather as much lead and copper as possible.\nMove on.
sector.frozenForest.description = Even here, closer to mountains, the spores have spread. The frigid temperatures cannot contain them forever.\n\nBegin the venture into power. Build combustion generators. Learn to use menders.
sector.saltFlats.description = On the outskirts of the desert lie the Salt Flats. Few resources can be found in this location.\n\nThe enemy has erected a resource storage complex here. Eradicate their core. Leave nothing standing.
sector.craters.description = Water has accumulated in this crater, relic of the old wars. Reclaim the area. Collect sand. Smelt metaglass. Pump water to cool turrets and drills.
sector.ruinousShores.description = Past the wastes, is the shoreline. Once, this location housed a coastal defense array. Not much of it remains. Only the most basic defense structures have remained unscathed, everything else reduced to scrap.\nContinue the expansion outwards. Rediscover the technology.
sector.stainedMountains.description = Further inland lie the mountains, yet untainted by spores.\nExtract the abundant titanium in this area. Learn how to use it.\n\nThe enemy presence is greater here. Do not give them time to send their strongest units.
sector.overgrowth.description = This area is overgrown, closer to the source of the spores.\nThe enemy has established an outpost here. Build Titan units. Destroy it. Reclaim that which was lost.

sector.biomassFacility.description = The origin of spores. This is the facility in which they were researched and initially produced.\nResearch the technology contained within. Cultivate spores for the production of fuel and plastics.\n\n[lightgray]Upon this facility's demise, the spores were released. Nothing in the local ecosystem could compete with such an invasive organism.
sector.windsweptIslands.description = Further past the shoreline is this remote chain of islands. Records show they once had [accent]Plastanium[]-producing structures.\n\nFend off the enemy's naval units. Establish a base on the islands. Research these factories.
sector.extractionOutpost.description = A remote outpost, constructed by the enemy for the purpose of launching resources to other sectors.\n\nCross-sector transport technology is essential for further conquest. Destroy the base. Research their Launch Pads.
sector.impact0078.description = Here lie remnants of the interstellar transport vessel that first entered this system.\n\nSalvage as much as possible from the wreckage. Research any intact technology.
sector.planetaryTerminal.description = The final target.\n\nThis coastal base contains a structure capable of launching Cores to local planets. It is extremely well guarded.\n\nProduce naval units. Eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible. Research the launch structure.
