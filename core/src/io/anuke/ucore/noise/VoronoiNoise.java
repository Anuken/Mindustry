	   /// In mathematics, a <i>Voronoi cell</i> is a region containing all the
	   /// points that are closer to a specific <i>seed point</i> than to any
	   /// other seed point.  These cells mesh with one another, producing
	   /// polygon-like formations.
	   ///
	   /// By default, this noise module randomly places a seed point within
	   /// each unit cube.  By modifying the <i>frequency</i> of the seed points,
	   /// an application can change the distance between seed points.  The
	   /// higher the frequency, the closer together this noise module places
	   /// the seed points, which reduces the size of the cells.  To specify the
	   /// frequency of the cells, call the setFrequency() method.
	   ///
	   /// This noise module assigns each Voronoi cell with a random constant
	   /// value from a coherent-noise function.  The <i>displacement value</i>
	   /// controls the range of random values to assign to each cell.  The
	   /// range of random values is +/- the displacement value.  Call the
	   /// setDisplacement() method to specify the displacement value.
	   ///
	   /// To modify the random positions of the seed points, call the SetSeed()
	   /// method.
	   ///
	   /// This noise module can optionally add the distance from the nearest
	   /// seed to the output value.  To enable this feature, call the
	   /// enableDistance() method.  This causes the points in the Voronoi cells
	   /// to increase in value the further away that point is from the nearest
	   /// seed point.
