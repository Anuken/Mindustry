/**
 * {@code SoftRoleSlotAssignmentStrategy} is a concrete implementation of {@link BoundedSlotAssignmentStrategy} that supports soft
 * roles, i.e. roles that can be broken. Rather than a member having a list of roles it can fulfill, it has a set of values
 * representing how difficult it would find it to fulfill every role. The value is known as the slot cost. To make a slot
 * impossible for a member to fill, its slot cost should be infinite (you can even set a threshold to ignore all slots whose cost
 * is too high; this will reduce computation time when several costs are exceeding). To make a slot ideal for a member, its slot
 * cost should be zero. We can have different levels of unsuitable assignment for one member.
 * <p>
 * Slot costs do not necessarily have to depend only on the member and the slot roles. They can be generalized to include any
 * difficulty a member might have in taking up a slot. If a formation is spread out, for example, a member may choose a slot that
 * is close by over a more distant slot. Distance can be directly used as a slot cost.
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANVec2 NOTES:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>In order for the algorithm to work properly the slot costs can not be negative.</li>
 * <li>This algorithm is often not fast enough to be used regularly. However, slot assignment happens relatively seldom (when the
 * player selects a new pattern, for example, or adds a member to the formation, or a member is removed from the formation).</li>
 * </ul>
