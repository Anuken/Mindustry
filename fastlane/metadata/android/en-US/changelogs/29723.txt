Only a few days left until stable 6.0 release now. The campaign should now be playable; I've done a playthrough and fixed all the bugs and irregularities I encountered.

Aside from internal modding API changes and potential bugfixes, 6.0 should not have any more additions.

- Added basalt boulder decoration block
- Added hint about generator use & power transfer
- Made power node placement smarter
- Buffed Lancer turret

Campaign:
