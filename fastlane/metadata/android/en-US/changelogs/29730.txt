This should be one of the last beta builds. In a couple of days, I will make a final release with the most recent translation bundles & bugfixes.

- Fixed infinitely looping Vela laser sound
- Fixed fire not burning on tar
- Disabled fire for items with flammability <= 1 (this means coal bombing no longer causes fire)
- Disabled unit explosion team damage
- Disabled core unit crash damage
- Disabled automatic linking of adjacent bridges
