[This is a truncated changelog, see Github for full notes]
As 6.0 is more or less stable now, updates have slowed down significantly. This is likely to be one of the last notable releases before 7.0.

- Fixed same-line logic comments not parsing
- Fixed mass driver rotating before payload is received
- Fixed bullets dealing splash damage twice upon collision - splash damage of certain bullets has been increased to compensate
