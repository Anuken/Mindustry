[This is a truncated changelog, see Github for full notes]
This is a minor update that reduces building splash damage for certain projectiles and fixes various mods issues.
While build 125 servers should be compatible with 125.1 clients, updating is still recommended.

- Fixed player health bar glitching out at negative health
- Fixed large power nodes sometimes not connecting to placed blocks
- Made unit payloads draw with correct cell colors
